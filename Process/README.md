# 09.23.20 - Beginning Thoughts (Brainstorming)

I still have to commit to the theme for one of my possible shmup ideas before changing the sprites, but I know for any of the games I create there will need to be either a moving background or multiple screens. Also the player object will need the mechanic of moving freely around which means there must be a bigger playing area and the enemy behavior will need to change to moving around the screen more dynamically.

# 09.28.20 - Shmup Idea Refinement 
 I decided to go with my idea of a hot air balloon themed shooter as I already had been thinking of ways I could implement mechanics into unity and developing ideas for the appearance and gameplay. Using Fullerton's formal game design elements I was able to break up the aspects of the game into its elements to explore how it will possibly look when completed. 
 -Objective: The player must attempt to stay alive for as long as possible in order to get the highest score while eliminating enemies and dodging their projectiles. The difficulty of the objective will increase the longer the player is able to stay alive.
 -Resources: This game will include not only the players health but also their ships health as it will include aspects of ship management in order to keep the hot air balloon moving. There could be collectable things to help fix the hot air balloon when it takes damage such as cloth to patch it up and rope to fix the fraying rope connecting the basket. Also the air balloon will have fuel that is being used up by the fire in order to keep it floating, that the player will need to refill when it begins to run low. 
 -Rules: The air balloon will be constrained by the player needing to manage it and so it will require the players attention in order to keep them alive and shooting. The player will stay in the airballoon at all times and only able to do one action at a time so they cannot both shoot and fix their balloon. The balloon can be made stronger or improved with items as the difficulty increases.
 -Procedures: The objective is accomplished by shooting to destroy the various enemies while avoiding being hit. Collecting items will allow new ways to shoot, resources for staying alive, or change gameplay providing powerups with advantages for trade-offs.
 -Conflict: The conflict emerges from the enemies who keep coming and shooting at the player in increasing difficulty as the game goes on. There could also be obstacles or environmental issues like birds, or floating traps to avoid.
