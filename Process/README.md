# 09.23.20 - Beginning Thoughts (Brainstorming)

I still have to commit to the theme for one of my possible shmup ideas before changing the sprites, but I know for any of the games I create there will need to be either a moving background or multiple screens. Also the player object will need the mechanic of moving freely around which means there must be a bigger playing area and the enemy behavior will need to change to moving around the screen more dynamically.
